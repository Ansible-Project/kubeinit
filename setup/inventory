# Setup host definition
#

# This inventory will have one host identified as the setup host. By default, this function
# will be assumed by the first hypervisor host, which is the same behavior as the first commented
# out line. The second commented out line would set the second hypervisor to be the setup
# host. The final commented out line would set the setup host to be a different host that is
# not being used as a hypervisor in this inventory.
